Hello everybody!
my name is Rodolfo Arzat, i'm from mexico and i'm 24 years old. I'm a student in udg studying engineering in robotics.
I've been facinated with robots ever since i was little, this facination led me to learn how to speak english and to code at a very early age, this is why i would say that these two things are what i'm best at.

currently working on a UI to connect Kinova Gen3 lite robots with an easy to use interface for other students.

reach me on rodolfo.rodriguez3150@alumnos.udg.mx
